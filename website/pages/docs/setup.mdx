## Boilerplate
```bash showLineNumbers copyable
npx nestia start <directory>
```

Just run above `npx nestia start <directory>` command.

Boilerplate would be automatically constructed in the `<directory>`.




## Setup
### Setup Wizard
```bash showLineNumbers copy
npm install --save-dev nestia
npx nestia setup
```

When you want to setup `nestia` in exiting project, just run above `npx nestia setup` command.

Setup Wizard will install and configure everything automatically.

### Webpack
When you want to bundle your NestJS project into a single file, you have to install `webpack` manually.  

Never run `nest build --webpack` command of `@nestjs/cli`, because it is not compatible with `nestia`.

```bash showLineNumbers copy
# SETUP NESTIA
npm install --save-dev nestia
npx nestia setup

# INSTALL WEBPACK
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-node-externals
```

After installing both `nestia` and `webpack`, configure `webpack.config.js` file like below. 

If required, update `entry`, `output` or `optimization` properties as you want.

```javascript filename="webpack.config.js" showLineNumbers copy
const path = require("path");
const nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals');

module.exports = {
    // CUSTOMIZE HERE
    entry: ['./src/main.ts'],
    output: {
        path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'main.js',
    },
    optimization: {
        minimize: false
    },

    // JUST KEEP THEM
    externals: [nodeExternals()],
    mode: 'development',
    target: 'node',
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.ts$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                loader: 'ts-loader',
            }
        ]
    },
    resolve: {
        extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.js'],
    },
};
```

After that, you can bundle your NestJS project into a single file, just by running `npx webpack` command.

```bash showLineNumbers copy
npx webpack
```

### Manual Setup
```bash showLineNumbers copyable
# COMPILERS
npm install --save-dev typescript
npm install --save-dev ts-node
npm install --save-dev ts-patch

# NESTIA
npm install --save-dev nestia
npm install --save-dev @nestia/sdk
npm install --save @nestia/core
```

If you want to install `nestia` manually, you have to install `ts-node` and `ts-patch` modules as well as `typescript`. After installing those compilers, install `nestia` libraries like above.

```json fileName="tsconfig.json"
{
    "strict": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "compilerOptions": {
        "plugins": [
            { "transform": "@nestia/core/lib/transform" },
            { "transform": "typia/lib/transform" },
        ],
    },
}
```

After that, configure `tsconfig.json` file like above.

As `@nestia/core` and `typia` are generating optimal validation and JSON serialization code through [transformation](https://typia.io/docs/setup/#transformation), you've to configure them as `plugins`. 

Also, never forget to configure `strict` (or `strictNullChecks`) as `true`. It is essential option for modern TypeScript development.

```json fileName="package.json"
{
    "scripts": {
        "prepare": "ts-patch install"
    }
}
```

At last, configure `npm run prepare` command like above. 

Of course, you've to run the `npm run prepare` command after configuration.

## Standard TypeScript Only
If you're using `@nestia/core` module, you've to use only standard TypeScript compiler.

Do you remember? `@nestia/core` boosts up [runtime validation](./core/typedbody) and [JSON serialization](./core/typedroute) through [AOT compilation](./pure/#aot-compilation). By the way, `@nestia/core` performs the AOT compilation through standardd TypeScript compiler API. Therefore, if you want to utilize those superfast decorators of `@nestia/core` module, you have to use only standard TypeScript compiler.

I also know that non-standard compilers are faster than standard. However, all of them are erasing type information, and skip typec checking, for rapid compilation. Without type information, `@nestia/core` can't do anything, and it is the reason why `@nestia/core` is not supporting them.

  - Standard TypeScript Compiler (keep type info)
    - [Microsoft/TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript)
  - Non-standard TypeScript Compilers (erase type info)
    - [SWC](https://swc.rs/)
    - [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
    - [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

    <Alert severity="info">
[SWC](https://swc.rs/) author is preparing a new project [STC](https://github.com/dudykr/stc), and it does not erase type info.

Therefore, `nestia` will support it.
